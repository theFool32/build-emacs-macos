Here you'll find a shell script for building emacs on macos, along with a few
other useful bits.

There is, of course, the great [[https://emacsformacosx.com][Emacs for macos]]. This is probably the most
straightforward way to get emacs for the mac. There is also [[https://brew.sh][homebrew]] and the
various ways of building emacs for that. Three great ones are:

- https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus
- https://github.com/daviderestivo/homebrew-emacs-head
- https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport

There are also a few great sources for looking at how to build emacs on macos. See
for example:

- https://github.com/jimeh/build-emacs-for-macos
- https://github.com/renard/emacs-build-macosx


So why another build script? Well, in keeping with the way I use emacs, I
wanted to be able to build it in the way that I preferred, using all the
options that I thought important. Plus I also wanted to understand more about
the build process. Since I'm not a programmer, I tried to write a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script][shell script]]
that would be as accessible to other non-programmers as possible. It was this
latter that I found particularly lacking in my search on the internet for
instructions about how to build emacs using any but the most basic of
settings. So below you'll find a discussion of the various contents of this
repo, what they do (to the best of my very limited knowledge) and why they are
there. Hopefully this will be of help to those people who, like myself, want
more control over how emacs works but lack much of the programming knowledge
that is assumed for building it.

*Note* that this build process currently works well for me using a 2021 M1 Macbook
Pro with Monterey 12.0.1. It should build either the latest emacs release, emacs
28, or the master branch just fine. I have not tested this on other machines or
for other kinds of build. Builds are specific to the machine on which they are
created, and not guaranteed to work without breakage on other machines (no
dylibs are included though see [[https://imrehorvath.wordpress.com/2021/04/17/wanna-build-gnu-emacs-on-macos-from-source/][here]] if you want something more self-contained).

** Emacs & Git
The first thing one needs to do in building emacs from the source files is
clone the emacs git repository. You can do this either by cloning from the
main repo: =git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git= or from
the github mirror: =git clone https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git=. It
doesn't really matter which one you choose. Clone it to somewhere
convenient on your system (I clone it to a subdirectory of this
=build-emacs= dir).

** Build Requirements
You'll need to install the following to build emacs. For convenience, you
can use the install script that I've provided in the repo. From the
emacs-build directory run =chmod u+x bemacs-requirements.sh= and then
=./bemacs-requirements.sh= and you should be all set.

- Xcode command line tools
- [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]]
- autoconf
- automake
- jpeg
- gnutls
- texinfo
- gcc
- libgccjit
- pkg-config
- jansson


** Config Options

[[file:config-options.txt][Config-options.txt]] lists the various options one can use to build emacs.
It is generated by running =./autogen.sh= in the emacs git repo. There are many
to choose from, though slightly [[https://github.com/renard/emacs-build-macosx#configuration-report][less so on macos]]. 

The options I use to build emacs currently are:

#+begin_src bash
./configure \
    --with-ns \
    --with-native-compilation \
    --with-xwidgets \
    --with-mailutils \
    --with-json \
    --with-modules \
    --without-compress-install \  # don't compress things like help & info files
    --with-dbus \ # this is mostly useless on mac but harmless to include
    --program-transform-name='s/^ctags$/emctags/' \ # avoid ctags namespace conflict
#+end_src

Depending on what version you're building you might also want to add =--with-treesitter= or other options new with emacs 29. For info consult [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.29][Emacs 29 News.]]

** Patches

These patches are various modifications applied to emacs during the build
process. You can read more about the =patch= command by running =man patch= on the
command line or looking at some of the examples[[https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/12/patch-command-examples/][ here]]. Currently the build script
uses all patches. If you don't want to use one of the patches below, remove it
from the =patches= directory or modify the build script (e.g by applying the
patches individually rather than as part of a =for= loop). Here are the patches
currently included:

- Emacs git version: allows for showing git sha1 version of the built emacs in
  =emacs-version= command
- Lion fullscreen: allow native fullscreen (especially useful for the new
  "notched" macbooks)
- No window refocus: better treatment of window focus transfer
- System appearance: allows for automatic theme switching with macos theme
  change; for an example of how to set it up see the [[file:patches/system-appearance.patch][patch]] or see the
  description [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus#system-appearance-change][here]]
- Windowing: better treatment with window managers; see [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/157][here]] for further discussion

** Build-emacs.sh

Please note that large portions of the build script are derived from, or
inspired by:

- https://github.com/renard/emacs-build-macosx (general structure)
- https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus (patches)
- https://github.com/jimeh/build-emacs-for-macos (instructions on build and config)

By default the build script builds off of the master branch but you can
also specify the version you want to build from any commit within recent
Emacs history (i.e. Emacs >= 24).

To *use* the build script simply:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure that you have cloned the emacs source (e.g. =git clone https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git=).
3. Get all requirements for build (=chmod u+x ./bemacs-requirements.sh= and =./bemacs-requirements.sh=)
4. Set the variables in the build script appropriately. Note that the Emacs source repo is set by default as being in the =~/Documents= directory. 
5. Make the script executable using =chmod u+x build-emacs.sh= and have the
   script in your path.
6. Run =./build-emacs.sh= (if you don't want to build from HEAD of the master
   branch you also need to include either the git sha1 or source/branch from
   which you are building)
7. Add emacs and emacsclient to your =PATH= by adding the following to your =.zshrc=
   or =.zprofile= (assuming you use zsh):

   #+begin_src sh
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin
   #+end_src

If you're wondering whether the most recent commit on =master= is stable, you
might check out [[https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds/issues/7][jimeh's]] "good-version" list of emacs-main versions to see which
git sha points to a stable commit.

** Build-logs

Each build with =build-emacs.sh= generates a subdirectory in =build-logs= with
a set of build logs organized by name, date, and commit.

** Materials

I've included a big-sur icon by memeplex (from [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/419][here]]). There is an info.plist
to transfer to the emacs build along with it. There is also an elisp file into
which the emacs build git sha1 will be inscribed and the file copied to the
emacs build's site-lisp (see the =SITELISP= variable in =build-emacs.sh=).
